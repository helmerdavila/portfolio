# 👨🏻‍💻 Helmer Portfolio 👨🏻‍💻

This is my current portfolio, I'm updating it as soon I dominate a specific technology of I work in a different project. Here you can see in a simple way how do I code usually.

## Stack

## Can I copy your portfolio?
For sure. Just make sure that you change at least the colors. I really like the colors that I chose for this project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the project with `npm start`. This will clean the build folder and start the project
4. Open the project in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`
5. Enjoy!
