# Docker MySQL - How to create two databases within the same container

## ðŸ¤” Why?

I was tired.

I only wanted to not pollute my Docker database with a bunch of fake names or lorem ipsum content. Because when I want to list all the records or photos in my current app, I want the original ones, for customer presentation.

Also, I wanted a dummy database where if my migrations fail, I can rolback them easily. Or destroy the database and create it again, without running seeders or using a backup with almost-real-data.

Many frameworks have different approach for this. Run tests inside transactions, do a cleanup, etc.

But I donâ€™t want to learn if they have it for every framework that I need to work over it.

However, the simplest way that I thought was...

What if I create a second database in the container? Better yet, in an automatic way?

## ðŸ”¨ How?

To demonstrate that I don't use AI to generate formal content in my posts, I will use `potato` as the project name in this tutorial.

First, create a folder where you want to store the scripts. For this tutorial, we'll call it `dockerdb_init`. Then, create a file called `create_test_database.sql` with the following content:

> Docker only creates one database with the environment variables passed. Since the project will use a test database, we could add a test suffix.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `potato_db_test`;
GRANT ALL ON `potato_db_test`.* TO 'potato_db_user'@'%'
```

Then, if youâ€™re using `docker-compose.yml` this is the specification for the container.

```yaml
db:
  container_name: potato_db
  image: 'mysql:8.0'
  volumes:
    - './dockerdb:/var/lib/mysql'
    - './dockerdb_init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d'
  env_file:
    - .env
  ports:
    - '3306:3306'
```

Since I prefer to keep my environment variables in a separate file, you can place the following content in your `.env` file:

```bash
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
MYSQL_DATABASE=potato_db
MYSQL_USER=potato_db_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=potato_db_pass
```

The first time the container turns on, it will run the script and now youâ€™ll have two databases: `potato_db` and `potato_db_test`.
