# Laravel Facades and Mockery, testing chained methods

## ðŸ¤” How this happened

I was trying to play with PHPUnit and Laravel. And I had this need to test Laravel Facades. Those were using a chained method.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

class ChainController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        Storage::disk('local')->put('/images/content', $request->file('demo'));

        return response()->json(['success' => true]);
    }
}
```

So, after this, my tests failed because it says that it can execute put on null . That meant, for some reason, the disk method was returning null, which I know wasnâ€™t true.

## ðŸ”¨ Solution

After some research. I found in the Mockery documentation (wich is what Laravel is using), that you need to specify to Mockery whatâ€™s returning your mocked function. In the following line, if I donâ€™t set the return, it will be null by default. And will cause next assertions to fail.

```php
<?php

Storage::disk('s3')->delete('/images/content/demo.png');
```

The solution to this comes from a simple method from Mockery `andReturnSelf` . Notice this depends on your class implementation, but the majority of chained methods would return the class by itself. Otherwise, you can use `andReturn` and write the object, string, array or data structure that the Mock will return.

For this specific case, I needed `andReturnSelf` . Letâ€™s see how the final result works. To test it, my `ChainController` is connected to the `POST /chain` route.

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ChainControllerTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_using_facades()
    {
        Storage::fake('local');

        Storage::shouldReceive('disk')->once()->with('local')->andReturnSelf();
        Storage::shouldReceive('put')->once()->withSomeOfArgs('/images/content');

        $response = $this->post('/chain', ['demo' => UploadedFile::fake()->image('hello.jpeg')]);
        $response->assertStatus(200);
    }
}
```
