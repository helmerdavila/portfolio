# Laravel - Update only blank/empty fields in models

In Laravel you have the `updateOrCreate` method, I was developing an application and I needed to update only the _blank_ fields, but the logic was the same as the update or create method, if the record doesn’t exist, the code needs to create it.

Then I thought, “What if I need the same methods in different models?”, the solution was so close, then I figured out the quickest for me: create a `Trait`

So, this trait takes the same params as `updateOrCreate` method, the filter attributes, and the filling values. I will show you the code, so you can replicate this feature in your own project.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Traits;

trait SecureUpdatable
{
    /** @method static $this updateBlankOrCreate($hashedId, array $columns = []) */

    /**
     * @param $attributes
     * @param $values
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|$this
     */
    public static function updateBlankOrCreate($attributes, $values)
    {
        /** @var \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $model */
        $model = static::firstOrNew($attributes);

        $blankValues = collect($values)->filter(function ($fieldValue, $fieldName) use ($model) {
            /** @var \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $model */
            return blank($model->getAttribute($fieldName));
        })->toArray();

        $model->fill($blankValues)->save();

        return $model;
    }
}
```

With this, you just need to include the trait into your Laravel Model: `use SecureUpdatable;`. Also, you have code completion for your IDE.

## How it works?

As you see tries to find the existing model or create a new instance with the static `firstOrNew` function. Then filter only the empty values with the blank helper from Laravel.
