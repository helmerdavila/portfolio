# CPanel SSL: Issue free certificates in a non-root server

Since some shared hosting providers are tied to an option to buy a SSL certificate, with the help of the `acme.sh` script, you can issue free SSL certificates following the instructions:

## 📈 Go to the Terminal into your CPanel or SSH there

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.localImages[0])} alt="CPanel" />

## ⬇️ Get the [acme.sh](http://acme.sh/) script

```bash
curl https://get.acme.sh | sh
```

## 🔃 Refresh the terminal

Re-enter to the terminal or simply run

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## ✉️ Register your email with the certificate

```bash
acme.sh —-register-account —-accountemail youremail@yourdomain.com
```

## ⏰ Check if cronjob was enabled by acme

```bash
crontab -l | grep acme.sh
```

The above command should output something like:

```bash
10 0 * * * “/home/*YOUR_CPANEL_USER*/.acme.sh”/acme.sh —- cron —- home “/home/*YOUR_CPANEL_USER*/.acme.sh” > /dev/null
```

## 📦 Set the domain variables in the terminal

```bash
export DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
# Press enter and write then
export WWWDOMAIN=www.yourdomain.com
# Don't forget to press enter again
```

## 🔑 Testing if the certificate generation works

Before testing if generate the certificate is allowed, you need the path of the domain / subdomain from your Cpanel. Execute the following command and you’ll get the path

```bash
export DOMAINPATH=$(uapi DomainInfo single_domain_data domain=$DOMAIN | grep documentroot| cut -d " " -f 6)
```

The result will be stored into **DOMAINPATH**

Then, you can use Acme to generate a **STAGING** certificate

```bash
acme.sh —-issue —-webroot ${DOMAINPATH} -d ${DOMAIN} -d ${WWWDOMAIN} —-staging
```

> Remember to only add `-d $WWWDOMAIN`, if you are using a `www` alias for your domain

If you receive green checks / messages. Congrats! You’re able to generate certificates into your Cpanel account.

## 🍄 Generating a real SSL certificate

```bash
acme.sh —-issue —-webroot ${DOMAINPATH} -d ${DOMAIN} -d ${WWWDOMAIN} —-force
```

## ➕ Add your certificate to Cpanel

```bash
acme.sh —-deploy —-deploy-hook cpanel_uapi —-domain ${DOMAIN} --domain ${WWWDOMAIN}
```

> Remember, you’ll need to repeat each step from step “Set the domain variables in the terminal” and forward by each domain / subdomain whenever you add it.
