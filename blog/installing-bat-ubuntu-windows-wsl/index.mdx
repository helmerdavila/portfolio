# Installing Bat in Ubuntu Windows WSL

## Downloading bat

I migrated to Windows and when I was installing Ubuntu through WSL I missed some tools that I have in my current MacBook, **BAT** was one of them. So as soon as I found a couple of guides online, here I will try to leave it as a reminder and with simple steps.

First, open your Windows Terminal (with Ubuntu) and search for the [latest version on GitHub](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases) . It was `0.22.1` for me.

Then check if you have wget working. The most common way to do it is checking it with `wget --version`, else use the following script:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget
```

Now you can download Bat with the following script, remember replacing `VERSION` by the latest version that you saw on Github.

```bash
wget https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/download/v${VERSION}/bat_${VERSION}_amd64.deb
# If we use 0.22.1 e.g:
# wget https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/download/v0.22.1/bat_0.22.1_amd64.deb
```

## Installing it using dpkg

Then you can use dpkg to install Debian packages

```bash
sudo dpkg -i bat_0.22.1_amd64.deb
```

And thatâ€™s all, now you can use bat to see the content of your files inside the terminal.
