# Mocking global variables in Python tests

I was trying to test some global variables with Python, specially for a script which contain global variables. And after trying and failing I think that I can show you the most simple version to do it.

## üèÉ The quick solution

```python
# demo_file.py
ENVS = { 'real_value': True, 'another_real_value': False }

# test_your_demo_file.py
mocker.patch("demo_file.ENVS", new={'MOCKED_NONE': None, 'MOCKED_EMPTY': ''})
```

Then into your `demo_file` the ENVS variable would be mocked.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Solution with description

### üìî Requirements

- For simplicity of work. I‚Äôd recommend the following library: [https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock/](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock/)

### ü§î What I was trying to do?

First, let‚Äôs suppose that you have a file called `demo_file.py` with the following content (and where the global variable is located.

```python
# demo_file.py
import os

ENVS = { 'real_value': os.environ('REAL_VALUE'), 'another_real_value': os.environ('ANOTHER_REAL_VALUE') }

def simple_method():
		print(ENVS)
		return 0
```

If you try to execute `simple_method` it will print the the dictionary with `real_value` and `another_real_value` there.

Now we have the following test file.

```python
# test_my_envs.py
from demo_file import simple_method

def test_if_simple_method_is_working():
		assert simple_method() == 0
```

I know the test seems simple, but it‚Äôs making sure that at least is returning a zero value after printing ENV‚Äôs values.

### üëæ Mocking the variable

But as you see we are calling to environment variables in the current computer, and if you write your tests waiting to have those into your CI/CD server, the tests are going to start failing. How we can avoid that and tell to our test server (or test pipeline) that we want specific fixed values?

If you installed the package mentioned above, in the requirements section, it‚Äôs pretty easy to start mocking values. So, we only need to add a single line.

```python
# test_my_envs.py
from demo_file import simple_method

@mocker.patch("demo_file.ENVS", new={'MOCKED_REAL_VALUE': None, 'MOCKED_ANOTHER_REAL_VALUE': ''})
def test_if_simple_method_is_working():
		assert simple_method() == 0
```

And your tests won‚Äôt execute the real ENVS variable and, therefore, call to `os.environ`.
