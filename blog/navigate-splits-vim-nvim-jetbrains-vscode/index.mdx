# Vim, Jetbrains or Vscode Vim Mode: A better shortcut to navigate between splits

## ü§î Why I wanted to avoid using the default shortcut

I got used to the VIM workflow since 1 year ago. And since I‚Äôm a heavy user between panes and the file tree. I wanted to implement a better way to do it. Let‚Äôs remember that VIM (or any editor with a mode based on it), brings default shortcuts to accomplish that.

`^` + `w` + ( `h` or `j` or `k` or `l`) = Move between panels

Windows and Linux users replace the `^` with `Ctrl` .

But what if we just skip that `w` ? Since we move between lines with `hjkl` . Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to add `Ctrl` or `^` and the direction key to move between panes? I often move between splits in VIM, Neovim, Jetbrains and Vscode. So I wanted to have a unified flow. Here is how I accomplished it.

## üõ† Vim & Neovim solution

I put next content in `~/.vimrc` or my `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` file.

```vim
map <C-j> <C-W>j
map <C-k> <C-W>k
map <C-h> <C-W>h
map <C-l> <C-W>l
```

## üõ† Vscode solution

It must be edited in the `settings.json` file from Vscode. This works if you‚Äôre using the [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) package.

```jsonp
"vim.normalModeKeyBindings": [
    {
      "before": ["<C-k>"],
      "commands": ["workbench.action.navigateUp"]
    },
    {
      "before": ["<C-j>"],
      "commands": ["workbench.action.navigateDown"]
    },
    {
      "before": ["<C-h>"],
      "commands": ["workbench.action.navigateLeft"]
    },
    {
      "before": ["<C-l>"],
      "commands": ["workbench.action.navigateRight"]
    }
  ],
```

## üõ† Jetbrains solution

Remember to install [Ideavim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim). This will look any config into your `~/.ideavimrc`

```vim
:map <C-j> <C-W>j
:map <C-k> <C-W>k
:map <C-h> <C-W>h
:map <C-l> <C-W>l
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Testing it

To make it work, restart any of your editors. Now you should be able to move quickly between panes.
