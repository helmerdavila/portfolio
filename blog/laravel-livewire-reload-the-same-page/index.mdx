# Laravel Livewire: Reload same page after some event and time

In order to enhance the user experience on your e-commerce site, it may be beneficial to implement a delay before the success message appears. This can be achieved using Livewire, a library that allows you to create reactive interfaces in Laravel. By utilizing Livewire, you can reload the page after a short delay of two seconds, giving the user time to review the product they have added to their cart. This simple yet effective feature can make a big difference in the overall purchase experience of your customers.

## How?

To be honest, the solution is pretty simple. You just need to have a variable in the view, which in this case can be named `$eventWasTriggered`.

```jsx
@if($eventWasTriggered)
  <section>Product {{ $product->name }} added to the cart</section>
@endif
```

For live page refresh after an specific amount of time, we need to take advantage from Javascript. Create a `<script>` tag, and inside, use `window.location.reload` to refresh the page.

```jsx
<script>setTimeout(function () {window.location.reload()}, 2000)</script>
```

As you see, we have added a fixed time of 2 seconds. Feel free to use another value according your application needs. Another variant could be getting the time as PHP variable from the backend.

Here is the final script.

```jsx
@if($eventWasTriggered)
  <section>Product {{ $product->name }} added to the cart</section>
  <script>
    setTimeout(function () { window.location.reload() }, 2000)
  </script>
@endif
```

## Conclusion

Remember that at the end of the day, Livewire is JavaScript, so some single-page application approaches are still valid for it.
